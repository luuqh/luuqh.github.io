##[Setup Apple silicon Mac for Deep Learning](https://github.com/luuqh/luuqh.github.io/blob/main/m1tf.md)

Apple silicon-based products released in the end of 2020 are the game-changer. Mac computers with Apple silicon can run much faster than the Intel-based competitors for the same configuration. More interestingly, you can use your Mac for data science and machine learning tasks. Please see [this link]((https://github.com/luuqh/luuqh.github.io/blob/main/m1tf.md)) for instruction.


##[Setup Ubuntu System for Deep Learning](https://github.com/luuqh/luuqh.github.io/blob/main/utf.md)

While Apple Mac is a reasonable choice to play around with data analytics, most of deep learning tasks are executed on Linux-like systems. We will set up an Ubuntu system with NVIDIA graphic card and related CUDA libraries. Please see [this link](https://github.com/luuqh/luuqh.github.io/blob/main/utf.md) for instruction.
